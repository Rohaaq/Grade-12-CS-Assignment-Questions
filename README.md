My CS teacher assigned problems to test various programming-related skills. These were challenging questions that required me to execute tasks with recursion and put my math skills to the test.

Unfortunately, Repl.It has completely discontinued Replit for Education, so I am working to redo the questions that I lost. They will be updated here as they get completed.
